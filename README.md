# wireshark-scripts
LUA scripts to decode GSSI messages (on TCP)
Wireshark plug-ins written for MS Windows. Also works on Linux.
No special tool used, I just use vi to edit the scripts.

For now, I put the scripts in the same dir as the .exe in: 
\ProgramFiles\wireshark\gssi.lua and 
\ProgramFiles\wireshark\init.lua

In linux, it is typically in:
/usr/local/share/wireshark/gssi.lua
/usr/local/share/wireshark/init.lua

Wireshark searches multiple directories for plug-ins, it is too involved to be covered here.
